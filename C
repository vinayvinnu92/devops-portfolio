The Nautilus Application development team recently finished development of one of the apps that they want to deploy on a containerized platform. The Nautilus Application development and DevOps teams met to discuss some of the basic pre-requisites and requirements to complete the deployment. The team wants to test the deployment on one of the app servers before going live and set up a complete containerized stack using a docker compose fie. Below are the details of the task: On App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter create a docker compose file /opt/devops/docker-compose.yml (should be named exactly). The compose should deploy two services (web and DB), and each service should deploy a container as per details below: For web service: a. Container name must be php_host. b. Use image php with any apache tag. Check here for more details. c. Map php_host container's port 80 with host port 3003 d. Map php_host container's /var/www/html volume with host volume /var/www/html. For DB service: a. Container name must be mysql_host. b. Use image mariadb with any tag (preferably latest). Check here for more details. c. Map mysql_host container's port 3306 with host port 3306 d. Map mysql_host container's /var/lib/mysql volume with host volume /var/lib/mysql. e. Set MYSQL_DATABASE=database_host and use any custom user ( except root ) with some complex password for DB connections. After running docker-compose up you can access the app with curl command curl <server-ip or hostname>:3003/ For more details check here. Note: Once you click on FINISH button, all currently running/stopped containers will be destroyed and stack
will be deployed again using your compose file.

Here’s a diagram for your Docker Compose stack on App Server 3 showing the web (PHP+Apache) and database (MariaDB) services, volumes, ports, and network connectivity:

                     +-----------------------+
                     |    Host: App Server 3 |

#Here’s a one-line summary of the commands you would use on App Server 3 to deploy your Docker Compose stack:

sudo mkdir -p /opt/devops && cd /opt/devops && sudo tee docker-compose.yml > /dev/null <<'EOF'
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    container_name: php_host
    image: php:8.2-apache
    ports:
      - "3003:80"
    volumes:
      - /var/www/html:/var/www/html
    networks:
      - app_net

  db:
    container_name: mysql_host
    image: mariadb:latest
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: database_host
      MYSQL_USER: appuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: ComplexPass123!
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: RootPass123!
    networks:
      - app_net

networks:
  app_net:
    driver: bridge
#EOF
sudo docker compose up -d && sudo docker compose ps

#Explanation of the one-liner:
#mkdir -p /opt/devops → creates the directory for your compose file.
#cd /opt/devops → navigate to the directory.
#tee docker-compose.yml → writes the Docker Compose YAML content to the file.
#sudo docker compose up -d → deploys the stack in detached mode.
#sudo docker compose ps → verifies that containers are running.
#✅ This single sequence will create the file, deploy the stack, and show running containers.

Do you want me to also provide a version using the old docker-compose command for older systems?
